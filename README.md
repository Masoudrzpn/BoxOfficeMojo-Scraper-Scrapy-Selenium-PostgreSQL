# BoxOfficeMojo-Scraper-Scrapy-Selenium-PostgreSQL
This repository contains a robust implementation for scraping movie data from the **BoxOfficeMojo** website using **Scrapy** and **Selenium**. The project collects data about top-grossing movies, including their rank, title, lifetime gross, year, budget, MPAA rating, and runtime.
